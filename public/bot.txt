Here's what you need to do next
If your domain points to a server you own, add domain-name.is-a.dev to your server config. For https, you will have to configure ssl certificate to allow the new subdomain.

For github pages users,
Go to your github page repo (user/user.github.io)
Open up the settings tab
Scroll down to the Github pages section
In the Custom domain text input, enter the domain you registered (domain-name.is-a.dev)
Check the Enforce HTTPS checkbox below the input
Give it some time to reflect and you should be good to go
